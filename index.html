    <h1><strong> Dear Darling </strong></h1>

        <p><em>
                Let me start this letter by saying I never, ever, ever meant to hurt your feelings. It's the last thing I would ever want to do. If you don't believe anything else, please know that. Please know that I am sorry beyond any of the words I put to paper. Hurting someone you love and knowing that you are the one that caused the pain is more than I can bare. You are my best friend, my girlfriend, and the light of my life. Whenever we were apart and I used to think about you, a smile would come to my face. Whenever we were apart and I used to think about you, a smile would come to my face. 
        </em></p>

        <p><em>
                You were and are my 'happy place'. But now when I think of you, all I see is the hurt in your face. And, the smile that used to come so naturally and automatically to me, is now replaced with a frown. 
        </em></p>

        <p><em>
                So here I stand in front of you, asking for your forgiveness and promising you that the lies and hurtful behavior is over. I promise you that it will never happen again. I hope you'll continue to have faith in me and let me prove myself to you so that one day in the future when I think of you, that smile returns to my face. 
        </em></p>
