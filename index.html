                            Dear Darling

        <p><em>
                Let me start this letter by saying I never, ever, ever meant to hurt your feelings. It's the last thing I would ever want to do. If you don't believe anything else, please know that. Please know that I am sorry beyond any of the words I put to paper. Hurting someone you love and knowing that you are the one that caused the pain is more than I can bare. You are my best friend, my girlfriend, and the light of my life. Whenever we were apart and I used to think about you, a smile would come to my face. Whenever we were apart and I used to think about you, a smile would come to my face. 
        </em></p>

        <p><em>
                You were and are my 'happy place'. But now when I think of you, all I see is the hurt in your face. And, the smile that used to come so naturally and automatically to me, is now replaced with a frown. 
        </em></p>

        <p><em>
                So here I stand in front of you, asking for your forgiveness and promising you that the lies and hurtful behavior is over. I promise you that it will never happen again. I hope you'll continue to have faith in me and let me prove myself to you so that one day in the future when I think of you, that smile returns to my face. 
        </em></p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <!-- Ordered list for the instructions -->

                <ol>
                        <li>Using 2 Tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the pieces of the chicken so each side is browned. They do not need to be fully cooked all the way through. Work in batches, and set aside when you’re done.</li>
                        
                </br>

                        <li>Melt another 2 Tbsp of butter in the pan over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until beginning to soften — about three minutes. Add the garlic, garam masala, ginger, chili powder, cumin, and cayenne. Stir to combine, and cook for about 45 seconds before adding the tomato sauce.</li>

                </br>

                        <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer and let cook for five minutes before adding the cream. Bring the mixture back to a simmer, add the browned chicken, and let simmer for 10-15 minutes. Keep the heat low here — not a rolling boil.</li>

                </br>           

                        <li>Stir in the remaining 2 Tbsp of butter, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>

                </br>

                        <li>Serve garnished with lime and cilantro, alongside rice and naan.</li>
        
                </ol>
